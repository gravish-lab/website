# Bioinspired mobile robotics

__Nick Gravish__


## Overview
This course presents an overview of bio-inspired mobile robotics using lecture and project based work. We will cover mobility modes including: legged locomotion (running/climbing), flight (flapping wing, fixed wing), serpentine (sidewinding), and swimming. The course will present the history and state of the art in mobile robotics from a practical perspective. 1) Why bio-inspired and what does that entail for a robotics engineer?, 2) How do we design, component select, and control bio-inspired mobile robots?, 3) What are the relevant dynamics/mechanics, control, and components used in differnt modes of bio-inspired locomotion. 

## Topics
Walking/running robots
Flying robots
Swimming robots
Snake robots

## Project 
In this class we will develop a direct-drive robot leg. We will study leg design, actuation, and control in the context of jumping, 2D hopping, and running. Project work will require python and C++ programming and hands-on design skills.
