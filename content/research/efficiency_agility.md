Locomotion power efficiency of milli-scale robots can be improved by designing resonant actuation systems. However, resonance and agility require conflicting modes of actuation: resonance requires actuation at a single frequency and agility favors actuation across a wide range of frequencies. We can resolve this conflict through mechanical design in microrobots. Through this project we seek principles of mechanical design for agile and efficient microrobots.
