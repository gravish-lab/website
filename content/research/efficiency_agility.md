Locomotion power efficiency of milli-scale robots can be improved by designing resonant actuation systems. However, resonance which favors actuation at a specific frequency, and agility which favors actuation across a wide range of frequencies are in conflict. We explore how mechanical design can resolve this conflict and enable agile and low-power microrobots.
