Insect-scale flight occurs in complex aerial and environmental conditions. To understand how flight performance is influenced by perturbations or aerial environments we study the flight control strategies of bumblebees. We record and track bumblebee flight in challenging flight conditions to build a better understanding of the control and physics of flapping wing flight.
