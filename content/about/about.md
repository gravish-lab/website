The Gravish Lab was founded in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UC San Diego in July, 2016 by PI [Nick Gravish](http://web.eng.ucsd.edu/~ngravish/). We are currently seeking recruiting PhD students in engineering and science to work with us. 

We value outreach and education. If you are interested in outreach opportunities please contact PI Gravish.
