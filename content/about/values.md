1. We support and value the contributions from all lab members. 

2. We believe that openness in science accelerates progress. The tools and scientific contributions from our lab will be made available to other scientists and engineers. We distribute open source tools---software and hardware.

3. We value the role of science education and seek opportunities to interact with local communities, we are so excited about our work that we can't wait to get other people excited about it.
